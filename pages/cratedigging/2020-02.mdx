<TrackTitle>DieMantle ‚Äì Gypsy Woman (Rave Yard Mix)</TrackTitle>
<SoundcloudPlayer src="https://soundcloud.com/dj_rave_on/gypsy-woman-rave-yard-mix" />

DieMantle delivers a rich, beakbeat rework of Crystal Water's Gypsy Woman.
Lush synths and piano stabs give this an old-school feel, it's the kind of timeless, classy shit I wish they pulled out
at house parties more often.

<TrackTitle>Guy J ‚Äì Mind Of</TrackTitle>
<SpotifyPlayer uri="spotify:track:1qkQXjgIy1xhgJAuFFLxu9" />

This is dark, brooding, melodic techno at it's best, methodically building to a ...well, you just gotta hear it.
The climax is so beautifully detailed and unexpected it completely took me by surprise. It's a stunning piece of work.
Don't understand how I haven't come across Guy J until this week. What a talent.

If you're a fan of this one, definitely check out the other track in this album ‚Äì [Day Of Light](https://open.spotify.com/track/78u645YMoEAY6QpacUVgrO?si=_pFfVyAfRZCOnPiqII_kkw) ‚Äì it's Mind Of's uplifting, tech house sister üòç

<SoundcloudPlayer src="https://soundcloud.com/sohaso/kiani-his-legion-i-can-take-you-there-if-you-let-me-take-you-sohaso-012" />

You know when you hear a track that instantly reminds you of something.
Well.. holy shit, this one did that to me ‚Äì instantly I was back at the outdoor raves of Summer 2019, just at that magical point right before sunrise.
[Kiani & His Legion](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5Mq9UFAr7R9KTwlFFiHVcQ?si=cgRk4HSKRXOg0bJen9gfFw) walk you down a reflective, dark mysterious path.
It's gorgeous, trippy downtempo electronica. Just. **Fucckkkkk**.

<SoundcloudPlayer src="https://soundcloud.com/houseum/premiere-madcat-heard-it-virage" />

Evoking warm feelings of nostalgia, this track takes you on a journey with lush, rising synths, powerful vocals and a driving house beat.
Would love to hear this in summer, outside, during sunset ...with an ice cold beer. Ooooh yea.

<TrackTitle>O'Flynn ‚Äì Glow Worm</TrackTitle>
<SoundcloudPlayer src="https://soundcloud.com/oflynnmusic/oflynn-glow-worm" />

A bouncy deep house track; equal parts playful and mysterious. I could listen to this on repeat for hours, it's remarkably detailed and nuanced.
Whilst we're here it's also worth mentioning O'Flynn's awesome 2019 release [Aletheia](https://open.spotify.com/album/0RVj8aaUuoTOZ7pyGjll6b?si=N2JdBrQNTbSjaBsNI45SNQ). It's full of lush, organic old-school dance music. Just awesome haha.

<TrackTitle>Simone Vitullo ‚Äì Feeling Good</TrackTitle>
<SpotifyPlayer uri="spotify:track:4wqtlpo7xtEmuY3zJjR2EE" />

Deep house remix of the classic song "Feeling Good" by Nina Simone.
It's a driving, mellow rework with piano stabs, haunting flute elements and spacious precussion.

<TrackTitle>Nosk ‚Äì Morning Song</TrackTitle>
<SpotifyPlayer uri="spotify:track:5UICfdbkT0bMu4N5eiPFjX" />

[Nosk](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6BIn4D5xGkDw8ndgoeR0u3?si=ZEgqCcG5Rsevjd0vvMyA4Q) seems to have flown under the radar, which is surprising because I listened to their entire discogrophy and absolutely loved _every single track_ they've released.
This one particularly stood out to me, walking that fine line between lively and mysterious. Oooh it gave me goosebumps.
If you wanna inject some brilliantly produced, rave-style breakbeat deviousness into your life then this is the track for you.
